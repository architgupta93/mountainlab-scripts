Instructions for setting up MountainLab (with trodes)
1. Use conda for setting up a virtual environment

            $ conda create -n mountainlab
            $ conda activate mountainlab

2. Install mountain lab, its processors and visualization tools
            $ conda install -c flatiron -c conda-forge mountainlab mountainlab_pytools
            $ conda install -c flatiron -c conda-forge ml_ephys
            $ conda install -c flatiron -c conda-forge qt-mountainview

The github page says that qt-mountainview is a temporary solution while they develop ephys-viz (In case stuff stops working in the future).

3. Test that the installation works by running their hello world process
            $ ml-run-process hello.world

4. Time to do some spike sorting.
    a. Generate MDA from the spike-gadgets .rec file
    exportmda -rec <rec_file> -outputdirectory <output_dir>
